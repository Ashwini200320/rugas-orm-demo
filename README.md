The Order Management System is a full-stack web application that enables users to onboard customers, manage products, and create and track orders. Customers' details, including name, address, phone, and email, are stored in a database. The product list includes name, category, description, images, and price. Users can place orders, filter them by status (Placed, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled), and update their status. The frontend (React.js/Vue.js) ensures a clean UI, while the backend (Node.js) handles business logic. SQL or NoSQL databases store data. Advanced features like state management, routing, and a dashboard for order statistics can enhance the project.
